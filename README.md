# üîê Password Manager CLI Tool

## About This Project
This is a beginner-friendly command-line password manager built in Python. It allows users to store, search, update, and export login credentials for various services ‚Äî all from a simple menu interface.

I created this project as part of my journey to become a junior developer. It reflects my growing skills in:
- Python scripting and automation
- Text formatting and file handling
- Input validation and user interaction
- Random password generation and secure design principles

## Features
- Add new login entries with custom or randomly generated passwords
- View all saved entries in a clean, formatted table
- Search entries by service name
- Update or delete existing credentials
- Export all entries to a `.txt` report
- Supports both English and Arabic usernames and services

## What I‚Äôm Practicing
This project helped me explore:
- `random`, `string`, and `sys` modules
- Dictionary operations like `.setdefault()` and `.items()`
- Text alignment using f-strings and `.format()`
- File writing and export logic
- Menu-driven program structure

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.12
- Standard libraries only ‚Äî no external dependencies

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-manager-cli.git
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python password_manager.py
   ```
3. Follow the menu prompts to manage your credentials.

## Future Improvements
- Encrypt stored passwords for added security
- Add login authentication to access the tool
- Build a GUI version with Tkinter or PyQt
- Save entries in JSON or SQLite for better structure
